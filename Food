// Donuts:
// Mix 1 package of yeast with 1/2 cup warm water
// Cream 1/2 cup shortening, 3/4 cup sugar, and 2 eggs
// Add yeast mixture after creaming
// Add 2 cups warm milk, 1/2 Tsp salt, and 1 Tsp vanilla
// Then 6-8 cups flour till the dough consistency is right
// Let rise over night
// Roll out dough and cut out donuts and let rise for 1 hr. 30 min
// Fry in shortening at around 300F (325F max) till golden brown.
// Much above 325F and the donut will get too crispy on the outside
// while still being doughy on the inside.
// They cook only one half at the time since they float in the oil so
// just flip over the donut to cook the other side.
// Glazing is a mix of confectionary sugar, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla
// that you make yo your own taste.

// Ravioli:
//
// Here is THE RECIPE used, consider that I didn't follow one but
// just used knowledge passed along but here is what I have done:
//
// Dough:
// 200 gr Durum wheat
// 100 gr White wheat
// Curry
// Tomato paste
//
// Stuffing:
// 300 gr Ricotta Cheese
// 400 gr Cleaned Spinaches
// 5-6 spoons of grated partigiano Reggiano
// Nutmeg
// 1 egg (optional)
// Salt
// Pepper
//
// Instructions:
// The dough is water and flour (1 part normal flour and 2 part durum flour)
// I started with 300gr of flour and add water carefully to
// allow proper mixing and have a firm smooth dough, after that I
// separated it 3 parts to one I added curry and mixed with until I had the nice
// color and smell I wanted, (don't know the grams of spice used sorry)
// for the second I added tomato paste and the third I left it plane.
// I used a pasta maker to roll the pasta I advise to start from the
// thickest setting and work your way to the desired thickness gradually setting
// the machine one step at the time and roll the pasta at each step,
// gradual transition of the pasta to the final thickness ensure extra
// smooth results on my machine, I used a final setting of 5 for the Ravioli and
// 4 for the spaghetti, the model I have has the extra tool for
// Spaghetti and Tagliatelle! <3
//
// The stuffing also very simple, boil the spinaches with very little water,
// drain and squeeze them to remove the excess water, cut them finely and
// put it in a large bowl with all the ingredients and mix it well.
// You can choose to lay down the stuffing with a spoon like I did or
// with help of a pastry bag, up to you.
//
// Once you have the rolled pasta and the stuffing ready you can start putting
// the stuffing on the pasta, I separated each drop of stuffing about 4 cm from
// one another, I used the roll as wide as they came out from the
// pasta machine and folded in half to have the two layers of the ravioli,
// with a tiny bit of water I "glued" the interior borders of the ravioli to
// ensure it will not open when boiling, and I cut the shapes using a pasta wheel.
//
// When you have finished cutting all the ravioli be sure they sit somewhere with
// enough flour under so that they don't stick to the surface,
// also in general when working with fresh pasta is always good to have
// extra flour to sprinkle around so it doesn't stick not only to the
// surface that is resting to but also in the rolling machine.
// I hope is all clear and that you will make amazing ravioli with this,
// I am here to answer all your questions, maybe in another post I will discuss
// the sauces I prepared to cook the ravioli and enhance the great flavors.



// Pizza
//
// Dough:
// 2 cups bread flour
// 2 tablespoons of sugar
// 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast
// 1 tablespoon salt
//
// Combine above ingredients until mixed together,
// then create a little mountain of the mixture. Create a “bowl” in the mixture,
// and slowly add 1 cup of ice cold water into the middle of the “bowl” pulling in
// flour from the outside. It really helps to pour the water in a small bit at a
// time for this step. Once your dough is a uniform consistency and you feel it’s
// not too dry or too wet, form into a ball. Drop it in a well oiled bowl covered
// tight with plastic wrap. Set in the fridge for a MINIMUM 24 hours (up to 48).
//
// The next day (or whenever you want to make your pizza) remove the dough from
// the bowl and set aside on baking sheet loosely covered in plastic wrap.
//
// At this point you should probably start with preheating your oven -
// we did it at 500°F (260°C) for 40 minutes. Place a pizza/baking stone on the
// top rack and a pizza pan on the lower rack in your oven -
// essentially making an oven in an oven.
//
// Now make your sauce:
// 2 cups canned peeled Italian tomatoes
// 1 teaspoon fresh oregano
// 1 teaspoon salt Combine in saucepan,
// bring to a simmer and crush chunks of tomatoes with a masher/hand blender -
// set aside.
//
// Shred some Mozzarella, Provolone, Fontina, Romano, and use
// sliced Fresh Mozzarella
// personally we used just a regular supermarket mozzarella
// so nothing fancy and it still turned out amazing.
// 
// Once you oven is done preheating, you can create your masterpiece;
// dust a counter liberally with flour or corn meal.
// Place your dough on the counter, and with flour dusted hands begin to
// form a pizza on the countertop. Once you have about a 10” round and leaving
// 1” for a crust, pick up the dough and using the outside of your
// knuckles stretch the dough out to the desired shape/size.
// TRUST YOUR GUT AT THIS STEP, take your time as it is not easy.
//
// Now sauce it, cheese it, and place it in your oven
// ON the pizza pan on the lower rack - leave in the oven for 10-12 minutes.
