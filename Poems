// I don't have regret for the things that I did -
// The stupid decisions I made as a kid.
// Not always the smartest -
// not always to plan -
// But still, as I made them, they made me a man.
//
// Perhaps, if I'd waited, it might have been fine -
// Or fated for futures all finer than mine.
// It might have brought all that I'd wanted about -
// But what if it didn't?
// I'd never find out.
//
// Perhaps I could better have sheltered myself -
// But life isn't meant to be lived on a shelf.
// Though some were a failure,
// and some were a fall -
//
// I'd only regret doing nothing at all.



// From time to time,
// I think of then.
// I turn my gaze before again.
// And though the sights are all a blur,
// I think of her,
// and who we were.
//
// From time to time,
// I think of then.
// I think of who and why and when
// And where she is,
// and what could be.
//
// I wonder if she thinks of me.



// Remember how we used to smile
// To share a foolish thought?
// To simply wait and walk a while?
// To talk of all, and nought?
//
// We'd spend our days and nights as two,
// Content to stare above.
// I always felt the same with you -
// It seemed a sort of love.
//
// And so we made it something more -
// But something came to end.
// We never found what came before.
//
// I miss my finest friend.
